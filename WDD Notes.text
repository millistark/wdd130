WDD Notes

Semantic:
    <article>
    <aside>
    <details>
    <figcaption>

        <div> is generic and meant to hold anything. Like a giant bowl/tupperware
        <span> is more "single serve" size. Content that is going to change in time
        Classes are for one or more
        ID is for 1

            lorem20 - will generate 20 gibberish words as place holder text
