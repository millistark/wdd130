            <h2>The Good, the Bad, and the...Weird?</h2>
            <p>With the rise of ChatGBT, many are using prompts to generate images for many uses. There are, however, many controversies on the use of AI. </p>

            <h3>The Cons</h3>
            <p>
            Artists in particular feel threatened by AI use because its ease of access takes clients away from them, diminishing their income. It's believed AI also initially was taught how to generate images based on many artists' artwork without their permission. According to OpenAI, Artists now have the ability to opt out of their art being used to train the generator. Despite this, many artists have stated how they still see their art used in the algorithm. The reality is that AI is not going away, and those seeking to make easy money are going to use AI generated art.
            Another con is the generator is limited to how descriptive you are. If you are too vague, you gamble how the image will turn out. Images with people will also be uncanny or not proportioned properly, such as having extra limbs or the eyes being improperly sized. In such a case, putting, “Generate a dog”, the generator has the opportunity to select the type of dog, and whether or not there will be a background. However, if you put, “generate a black dog with brown eyes wandering the plains of Kansas”, you’re more likely to get exactly that. There’s still a chance of inaccuracies, but that’s where the pros come into play.

            <h3>The Pros</h3>
            <p>
            Despite the unethical use by people who are irresponsible, there are many good things about AI generated art. A client can now generate references and ideas and share them with their designer. Even if the art is missing pieces, the image itself is meant to be used as a reference instead of as a final product. Artists in general don’t have to spend hours looking for specific references to help them create. 
            For me, this is a game changer. Instead of hundreds of thousands of photos kept in a digital or literal library, I now can input an exact prompt and get ideas for exactly what I’m looking for. I would sometimes spend hours looking for references to create fantasy creatures for books I wanted to write or characters I wanted to create for a Dungeons and Dragon campaign with friends.

            <h3>What Can We Learn?</h3>
            <P>
            AI art is as beneficial as the people who use it for its intended purpose; to generate art in a fraction of time within legal guidelines and obeying copyright laws. AI generated art can be an incredible tool for artists to expand their repertoire. Technology will always be progressing, and learning to utilize AI will be a benefit for all. Who knows what advances will be made in the coming years?
