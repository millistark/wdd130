            <h1>Artificial Intelligence: What is it?</h1>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence or "AI" was a term first used in the 1950s. Since then, there have been many innovations that have developed more advanced forms of AI. The most popular and commonly used form is ChatGBT, developed by OpenAI. OpenAI is a company whose primary focus is safety and beneficial use. There is both free access and paid. All of their research is available on their website, though it is difficult to understand if one is not familiar with the digital world. Other sources break down how AI art is generated using diffusion and a separate program called “CLIP”.</p>
