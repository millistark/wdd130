            AI, or "Artificial Intelligence" today plays a major role in our society. One of those roles that has taken the world by storm has been the use of AI generated art. AI technology appears to be our mordern Deus Ex Machina, a god in a machine. Bringing boundless ideas to life. It has brought many solutions to creative insights in odd and unexpected ways. Despite this technology flooding creative fields with new ideas, is this technology all that beneficial? And does it actually extend our imagination or will this inhuman intelligence take over the aspect of Human creativity? Explore this website to find out for yourself!

            All of the images provided on this site are AI generated by Dall-E. This was done to display the variaty of what AI can do in terms of visual arts. The same prompt can generate multiple images, and no two are exactly alike. For example, the image displayed on the left was generated with the simple prompt, "How AI sees Art". The prompt was generated twice to see if the images would be the exact same. Instead, the images that appeared the first time were actually more organic, with fields of grass and circuitry, the sky covered in an errie giant eye. I refreshed the prompt and got the image now displayed on this page. I felt the current image fit the purpose of this page better, and was less creepy. The picture is still uncanny, but does a wonderful job displaying AI interacting with what we view as art.
