            <h2>Ridding the Waves: Your Stories</h2>
            <img src="images\raftgroup.jpg" alt="raftgroup">
            <p>March 9, 2019: This week was definitly one for the books. Or blog in this case. The rapids on Green river were particularly strong on Wednesday, but that didn't stop this band of adventurers from braving the waves! These students from Colorado decided to use our services to bond closer as a student body. The picture shown is the group after an epic ride. They were roaring to go again! Their next trip took them down a different part of the river. Their raft took a tumble on one of the turns. Thanks to one of the students quick thinking, they were able to save their supplies. Everyone was safe, but unfortunally one lost their hat. There might be a very stylish crawdad in the river now.</p>
            <p>The Madison family had a reuion and decided racing down Salmon river was a fantastic idea to get everyone together. There were a few splash wars as they made their way down the river. After an entertaining race, they stopped for lunch and enjoyed sandwiches on the sandbar. There was a lot of laughter and appreciation for the outdoors. One little girl commented that she liked "seeing all the pretty leaves as they floated past and playing in the sand".</p>
