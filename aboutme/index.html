    <p>Hi there! I'm from Derby, Kansas. I'm currently pursuing a degree in Software engineering with a minor in creative writing and music recording. I'm also working on certificates in quality assurance and full stack development. The hope is to someday go into video game development or just make a game from scratch!
    I love being creative, so any crafty thing you can think of, I've probably dabbled in it. Painting, ceramics, airbrushing, pinstriping, crochet; I've done a lot!
    Some of my favorite games are Kingdom Hearts, Touch Detective, Hollow Knight, Stardew Valley, Minecraft, and a more obscure game called We Happy Few.
